# calculator
This is my Odin Project Calculator, which is the last project in the Foundations Course.

I based this calculator on my red calculator I had as a kid.

I did a few things I'm happy with in my final version. For example, I solved the issue of floating point math (e.g. 0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3). However, one thing I would change is my lack of functions called for certain actions that should be called by functions. I used a lot of boolean values to check for certain conditions rather than more functions, but I was trying to solve several input issues and keep this calculator to be as close to my childhood red calculator as possible.
